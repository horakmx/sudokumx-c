# sudokumx-c
Sudoku solver in c

Initial ideas behind this work
- build original solution without inspiration from other sources 
- make this program to be fast as possible

After comparison to other solvers by different authors I found (what a surprise) that fasters solvers exist.

You can see some of the fastest solutions here: https://github.com/horakmx/plb/tree/master/sudoku/incoming.

Fastest solution I can find is JSolve.c by Jason T. Linhart. (about 5x faster than sudokumx-c)
