## BU__views
**Input**
VIEWS (number 0-26) - iteration through 9*3 possible views (all columns, rows and boxes)
POINTS_PER_VIEW (number 0-8) - represents elements inside each VIEWS group
**Output**
array position of each individual element
**Description**
our board described as array with indexes (0-80)
[
   0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,
   9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
  18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26,
  27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35,
  36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44,
  45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53,

  72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80
]
than we can map each VIEWS set to this board
**Example**
{ 30, 31, 32, 39, 40, 41, 48, 49, 50 } => VIEW of centered box

## BU__digits
**Input**
DIGITS_OFFSETTED (number 0-9) - represents bit position
**Output**
bitmap - NULL / 0000000010 - 1000000000
**Description**
This is complementary map to BU__bitPositions
Used typically for iterating through 1-9 and instantly translating to map with lowest possible instructions
Then this map is used for binary operation
**Example**
How to know that 6th bit is set in this number (bitmap): 0110111100 ?
number & BU__digits(6) => False (0) or True (>0)
```
static CONST unsigned short BU__digits[DIGITS_OFFSETTED] = { 00, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 };
```

## BU__bitPositions
**Input**
PREPARED_BIT_TO_DIGIT (number 0-512) - represents bitmap 0000000000-1000000000
**Output**
confirmation - which single! bit (position) is set
**Description**
Used typically for detection on which single position is specific number available for instant-solving
Or could be used for detection which candidate (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) is only possible in specific position
**Example**
num  =>   bitmap   =>  confirmation about single bit position
 0  =>          0 =>    00  - nothing
 1  =>          1 =>     0  - first position is set (index starting at 0)
 2  =>         10 =>     1  - second position is set (index starting at 0)
 3  =>         11 =>    00
 4  =>        100 =>     2  - third position is set (index starting at 0)
...
512  => 1000000000 =>     9  - tenth position is set (index starting at 0)

## BU__lockedCandidates
**Input**
LOCKED_CANDIDATES (number 0-53) - iteration through 9*3*2 different combinations
LOCKED_CANDIDATE_SET_SIZE (number 0-14) - represents elements inside each LOCKED_CANDIDATES group
**Output**
array position of each individual element
**Description**
our board described as array with indexes (0-80)
[
   0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,
   9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
  18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26,
  27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35,

  72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80
]
than we can map each LOCKED_CANDIDATES set to this board
Hidden information - you have to know that:
first 3 elements in set we use as group A
next 6 elements as group B
remaining 6 elements as group C
**Example**
{ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 18, 19, 20 }
  A   A   A   B   B   B   B   B   B   C   C   C   C   C   C
first group of LOCKED_CANDIDATES
[
   0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,
   9, 10, 11,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,
  18, 19, 20,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,
    ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,
    ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,
    ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,

    ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,
    ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,
]
then we can use simplified further code to work with
elements of group A+B+C and do easy mathematical operations with this subsets
[
   A,  A,  A,  B,  B,  B,  B,  B,  B,
   C,  C,  C,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,
